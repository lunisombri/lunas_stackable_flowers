# 🌸 lunas-stackable-flowers
Minecraft mod: Bushier, stackable vanilla flowers.

# ✨ Features:

## 🌼 Stack Flowers in One Block

- Stack up to 6 flowers per block
- Inspired by wildflowers, but works with vanilla single flowers

## 🧭 Directional Placement

- Manual placement sets a facing direction (north, south, east, west) based on player orientation
- Models rotate correctly for each direction
- Flowers are stacked counter-clockwise from the right bottom corner

## 🪓 Tools Interaction (Re-shape Your Flowers)

Reimagine how you interact with flowers using tools:
- Shovel removes 1 flower from the stack
- Shears make your flower stack shorter
- Hoe sets a new direction for your flowers

## 🌿 Bonemeal Growth (with Control)

Using bonemeal grows the flower stack naturally

- Increases flower stack by 1, with no specific direction
- Makes your short flower stacks taller
